# thermometric-station
A small thermometric station built with an Arduino Uno and an ESP8266, using LabVIEW and Arduino IDE to setup the connections and parse the data derived from the DHT22 sensor.  Then you can visualize the data via a Web Server connected to a PostgreSQL Database, all managed through LabVIEW
